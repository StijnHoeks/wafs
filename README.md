## Advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript libraries/frameworks
+ Libraries are build up of pre written modules of code, wich makes it an easy and quick solution for developers.
+ Since these libraries are open source, the're used thoroughly tested by countless of developers: "Many eyes make all bugs shallow".
- It's better to fully understand the layers beneath (plain javascript) before using these libraries/frameworks. Doing so will help you understand what javascript actually does and thus wether, when and why you should make use of a library.
- Projects that heavily depend on external libraries could fall apart when internet connection is lost or the cdn used fails - or in worst case scenario - when a library is not being maintained, contributed or supported anymore.

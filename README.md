## Features
Get images from the Mars rovers, with meta data. Filter the results. Go to the detail page for an enhanced image display.

## Usage
Usage with mouse/trackpad.

## Whishlist
Currently it's only possible to filter rendered items. What i'd like to add is a function to make a custom api call based on the input of the user.
For the rest: epand, expand, expand! Giving the user access to more data instead of 25 images with two parameters (id and camera used).

## Advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript libraries/frameworks
+ Libraries are build up of pre written modules of code, wich makes it an easy and quick solution for developers.
+ Since these libraries are open source, the're thoroughly tested by countless of developers: "Many eyes make all bugs shallow".
- It's better to fully understand the layers beneath (plain javascript) before using these libraries/frameworks. Doing so will help you understand what javascript actually does and thus wether, when and why you should make use of a library.
- Projects that heavily depend on external libraries could fall apart when internet connection is lost or the cdn used fails - or in worst case scenario - when a library is not being maintained, contributed or supported anymore.

## Advantages and disadvantages of client-side single page web apps
+ Single page web apps don't have to reload the entire page to update content, only specific sets of new data are requested and sent as the user navigates through the application.
+ The developer has a the ability to create an immersive user experience
+ Only a single index file is needed.
- If javascript fails to load, there will be nothing.

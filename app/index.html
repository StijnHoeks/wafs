			<h2>Advantages of libraries/frameworks</h2>
			<li>+ Libraries are build up of pre written modules of code, wich makes it an easy and quick solution for developers.</li>
			<li>+ Since these libraries are open source, the're thoroughly tested by countless of developers: "Many eyes make all bugs shallow".</li>
			<h2>Disadvantages of libraries/frameworks</h2>
			<li>- It's better to fully understand the layers beneath (plain javascript) before using these libraries/frameworks. Doing so will help you understand what javascript actually does and wether you should make use of an external library.</li>
			<li>- Projects that heavily depend on external libraries could fall apart when internet connection is lost or the cdn used fails - or in worst case scenario - when a library is not being maintained, contributed or supported anymore.</li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Advantages of single page web app</h2>
			<li>+ Single page web apps don't have to reload the entire page to update content, only specific sets of new data are requested and sent as the user navigates through the application.</li>
			<li>+ The developer has a the ability to create an immersive user experience</li>
			<li>+ Only a single index file is needed.</li>
			<h2>Disadvantages of single page web app</h2>
			<li>- If javascript fails to load, there will be nothing.</li>
